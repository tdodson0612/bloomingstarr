Create a Roles & Permissions CONTRACT (No Code Yet)

Goal: Everyone codes against the same mental model

Write this down (README or Notion — not code):

Roles

Owner

Manager

Employee

Permissions (Phase 1)
Feature	Owner	Manager	Employee
View data tables	✅	✅	✅
Edit table names	✅	✅	❌
Edit columns	✅	✅	❌
Add/edit formulas	✅	✅	❌
Clock in/out	✅	✅	✅
Edit schedules	✅	✅	❌

⚠️ This becomes law. Code follows this later.
